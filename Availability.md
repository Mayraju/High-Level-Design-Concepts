Availability means system needs to up on everytime and accessible.

## What is Availablity?
   Availablity refers to the proportion of time a system is operational and accessible when required.

  it is usually expressed as a percentage, indicating the system's uptime over a specific period.

  ## The formal definition of availablity is:

           Availability = Uptime/(Uptime + Downtime)

            1. Uptime: The period during which a system is functional and accessible.
            2. Downtime: The Period during which a system is unavailable due to failures, maintenance, or other issues.

## Availability Tiers:

        Availability is often expressed in "nines". The higher the availablity, the less downtime there is.



        | Availability % | Downtime per year | Commonly referred as|
        |----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
        |      99%       |       3.65 days   |       "Two nines"   |
        |      99.9%     |       8.76 hours  |       "Three nines" |
        |      99.99%    |   52.56 minutes   |       "Four nines"  |
        |      99.999%   |   5.26 minutes    |        "Five nines" |
        |      99.9999%  |   31.5 seconds    |        "Six nines"  |

      Each additional "nine" represents an order of magnitude improvement in availabilty.
