Scalability means scaling(increase) the system to handle the growth or traffic.

Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of load by 'adding resources' to the system

example:

In festival seasons days Passengers higher than the normal days like increase no of buses, or increase the no of boxes in the trains, or more no of trains etc.

In the same way if we need to scale a software we have ram, cpu, storage etc...

How can a system grow?

1. More Users :

   a.more users started using system, leading to increased no of requests.
   examples: A social media platform experiencing a surge in new users

2. More Features:

   a. More Features were introduced to expand the system's capabilities.
   examples: An E-commerce website adding support for a new payment method.

3. More Data:

 a. Growth in the amount of data the system stores and manages due to user activity or logging)

 example: A video Streaming platform like youtube storing more video content over time.

4. More Complexity:

  a. The system's architecure evolves to accommodate new features,scale, or integrations, resulting in additional componenets and dependencies
   example: A system that started as a simple application is broken into smaller independent systems.

5. More Geographies:

    a. The System is expanded to serve users in new regions or countries
    examples: An e-commerce company launhing website and distributions in new international markets.

How to scale a System?

1. Vertical Scaling (Scale up):

    This means adding more power to your existing machines by upgrading server with more RAM,faster CPUs, or addtional storage.

    example:
       16GB --> 32 GB RAM
       1TB --> 2TB Spaces Hard disk

2. Horizontal Scalling (Scale Out):
    
    This means adding more Machines to your system to spread the workload across multiple servers

    examples:
     if i have i system with 16GB RAM, 1TB disk drive i add two more systems with same configuration.
     so, initial we have 1 system, now we have total 3 systems

3. Load Balancing
    
    Load balancing is the process of distrbuting traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server become bottleneck condition.

4. Caching

   Caching is a technique to store frequently accessed data in-memory (Like RAM) to reduce the load on the server or database.

   implmenting caching can dramatically improve response times.

5. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):

   CDN distributes static assets(images,Videos, etc) closer to users. this can reduce latency and result in faster load times.

   examples: CloudFlare provides CDN services,speeding up website access for users worldwide by caching content in servers located closers to users.

6. Sharding / Partitioning

    Partitioning means spliting data or functionality across multiple nodes/servers to distribute workload and avoid bottlenecks

    example: Amazon DynamoDB uses partitioning to distribute data and traffic for its NoSQL database service across many servers, ensuring fast performance and scalability.


7. Asynchronous Communication:

   Asynchronous communication means deferring long-running or non-critical tasks to backgroung queues or message brokers
   
   this ensures your main application remains responsive to users.

8. MicroServices Architecuture:
     
    Micro-Services architecture breaks down application into smaller, independent services that can be scaled independently.

    This improves resilience and allows teams to work on specific components in parallel

9. Auto-Scalling

    Auto-Scalling means automatically adjusting the number of active servers based on the current load.

    This ensures that the system can handle spikes in traffic without manual intervention

10. Multi-regin Deployment

      Deploy the application in multiple data centers or cloud regions to reduce latency and improve redundancy.
